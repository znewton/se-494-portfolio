## Plan

I plan for this site to be a clean and easy, one page scroll type portfolio with some nice angled dividers between sections. There will be a navbar at the top with my name *or* a logo for myself (if I feel like it) in the top left with section links at the top right. Mobile support is a secondary consideration cause this is just for course credit, not my actual portfolio site.

I will host it on github pages at [http://znewton.github.io/se-494-portfolio](http://znewton.github.io/se-494-portfolio).

All CSS will be custom cause that's the fun part.
